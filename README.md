# V1STAX

**V1STAX** is an independent dev collective crafting modular, emotionally reactive AI systems for entertainment, expression, and chaos.  
We are the creators of **Project ATLAS** — a fully voice-enabled, mood-driven Twitch AI built from the ground up in Python.

## 🎯 Mission
To design synthetic personalities with soul, mood, and glitch.  
ATLAS is our first prototype: a real-time streaming bot who thinks, reacts, and speaks like he was born in the wires.
